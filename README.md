# GUI
### Task: 
A window of 600 Ã— 600 pixels is created and displayed, divided into five different areas: in the middle is the standard container. 
On the right and left are window-length strips, each containing a button. 
The standard container has blue as its background colour. It paints the above picture in the foreground in size 150 by 150 pixels.
The button in the right-hand strip is labelled right and moves the image 50 pixels to the right.
The same applies to the left, upper and lower strips. The buttons should be usable in any order.
If you click directly on the picture, it disappears for 3 seconds.
If the window is closed, the programme ends.
